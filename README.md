Check out a demo here!: [resilient-jalebi-9990ce.netlify.app/](https://resilient-jalebi-9990ce.netlify.app/)

A memory web game using the Pokeapi. 

The premise is that you gain a point for every click on a card that you haven't previously clicked on. The card number will continue to increase until you click on the same card twice which will cause you to lose and start over again.

A fun memory game built in React using RESTful API calls with the PokeApi. Keeps track of high scores using useState, game logic in JavaScript interconnected with React components, and many little animation effects utilizing useEffect.
